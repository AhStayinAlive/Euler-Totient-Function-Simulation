# Euler-Totient-Function-Simulation
This project simulates the Euler Totient function using Verilog. It involves designing the EulerTotient module that takes clock (clk_0) and reset (R) signals to output values (A-G) representing a 7-segment display. The TestBench module tests this design by simulating various inputs and verifying the outputs.
